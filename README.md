# Analog-Electronic-ECG-Heart-Monitor

Our project involves a device that captures ECG signals through electrodes, filters them, and displays the data on a real-time graph. The challenge was to handle the small voltage range of ECG signals (0.1 mV to 10 mV) and mitigate noise. This was achieved using a leg drive circuit, an instrumentation amplifier, a high pass filter, a notch filter, and a low pass filter, considering the ECG signal bandwidth to be 160 Hz. The device was developed using only analog electronic components, while digital elements were used exclusively for the display the ECG signal. Additionally, a custom 3D enclosure was designed and constructed to house the device.
